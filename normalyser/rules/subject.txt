{{
    "normalized": {{
    "merchant": "<merchant_name>",
    "category": "<category>",
    "sub_category": "<sub_category>",
    "confidence": <confidence>,  // A number between 0 and 1 representing your confidence level.
    "is_subscription": <true/false>,  // Indicates if this is a subscription service.
    "flags": [<relevant flags>]  // Additional flags like "online_purchase", "marketplace", etc.
    }}
}}

Here's the input data:
